# Next-Word-Predictor-Project
The Next Word Predictor Model is an AI project that is able to accurately predict the next required words and display them along with the inputted sequence of texts. These types of linguistic predictors are used to enhance communication in applications such as messaging, content creation, etc.

This project has been implemented in the Python programming language and makes use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a type of the recurrent neural network (RNN) which is able to process long sequences of data and capture long term dependencies. The Dataset that I have used to train the model is the "Tatoeba: Collection of Sentences and translation".
